  Friday Big Deal Longread for 4/3: The NIH public access policy did not harm
  biomedical journals
---
As the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy is in the [midst of an inquiry](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/02/19/2020-03189/request-for-information-public-access-to-peer-reviewed-scholarly-publications-data-and-code) into whether and how to update federal open access policy, many are wondering whether increasing free access to research will undermine the ecosystem of scholarly journals. For a sense of what to expect, it's worth looking at how the National Institutes of Health policy, the longest-running federal open access policy, effected the biomedical journals where funded researchers were likely to publish.

The title of this week's Big Deal Longread says it all: "The NIH public access policy did not harm biomedical journals." Publishers raised all the same alarms in opposition to the NIH policyâ€”it would make it impossible for them to cover their cost (much less their 40% profit margins...) and peer review as we know it would come to a screeching halt. Science would fall apart. Dogs and cats would live together. You get the idea. Well, according to this week's study, _they were wrong_. From the abstract: 

> We show here that implementation of the NIH policy was associ- ated with slightly elevated mortality rates and mildly depressed natality rates of biomedical journals, but that birth rates so exceeded death rates that numbers of biomedical journals con- tinued to rise, even in the face of the implementation of such a sweeping public access policy.

Make no mistake: open access policies absolutely can and hopefully will erode the market power of big publishers. But "libraries might be able to cut a little into insane publisher profit margins" is a very long way from "the journal ecosystem as we know it will collapse." As Peterson et al. show, the journal ecosystem is quite robust.
