Today my friends Kendra Albert and Daina Bouquin, along with coauthors Alena Farber and Russell Hoover of the Cyberlaw Clinic at Harvard Law School, published the [Copyright Guide for Scientific Software](https://zenodo.org/record/3581326#.XflBxC-ZNQI). It's a really handy, short and sweet guide to the ways that copyright can impact the ways you use, reuse, and share the software that scientists make and use in their research. It's the first guide of its kind, to my knowledge, and should be required reading for any scientist who works with software.
