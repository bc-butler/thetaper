  Friday Big Deal Longread: Why Current Publication Practices May Distort
  Science
---
Yesterday I learned that the Vice Provost for Research here at UVA is hosting a half-day [workshop on scientific integrity](https://research.virginia.edu/scientific-integrity-workshop) in March. I'll be there, for sure, because when I saw the topic, I thought immediately of the Big Deal. If you're not steeped in this stuff, the notion that expensive, high-prestige journals would have a negative effect on the quality of science may be counterintuitive. Indeed, lower quality and lower "integrity" are more often associated with so-called "predatory" journals. 

This week's Big Deal Longread helps explain the connection between flawed science and Big Deal journal bundles. In "[Why Current Publication Practices May Distort Science](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050201)," the authors explain that the oligopoly of journal publishers and the artificial scarcity created by journal selectivity contribute to a system where the contest for highest "impact" will systematically undermine the accuracy of "winning" scientific articles. It's a compact read, and well worth your time. 

If you'd like to read more on this theme, our own Brian Nosek has written two excellent pieces ([Scientific Utopia I](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.1055.pdf), and [II](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1745691612459058)) exploring not only the downsides of the status quo, but also the upsides of a more open and transparent alternative. Bjorn Brembs has also written several essays arguing that high prestige and low quality are routinely and predictably correlated. You could start with "[Deep Impact: unintended consequences of journal rank](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full)," and then read "[Reliable novelty](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000117)."
