> [T]he argument that we’re all being egregiously and continuously screwed over by The Incentives is just not that good. I think there are a lot of reasons why researchers should be very hesitant to invoke The Incentives as a justification for why any of us behave the way we do. I’ll give nine of them here, but I imagine there are probably others. 

Read the whole thing: [No, it’s not The Incentives—it’s you – from [citation needed]](http://www.talyarkoni.org/blog/2018/10/02/no-its-not-the-incentives-its-you/)

I'm very much guilty of blaming the inertia against open access on P&T and career pressures, but Tal Yarkoni argues here that it's intellectually lazy to blame "The Incentives" for behaviors (publishing in toll access journals, p-hacking) that are objectively harmful to science.
