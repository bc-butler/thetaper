My friend and library copyright maven extraordinaire Nancy Sims has written the guide that we all may need sooner than we'd like to admit: [Rapidly shifting your course from in-person to online](https://www.lib.umn.edu/copyright/rapidly-shifting-a-course-online). If you're looking for good advice on this issue, check out Nancy's post. If you're not sure how it translates to our context here at UVA, drop me an email and I can help you work through it.
