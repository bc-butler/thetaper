title: Some thoughts on the next Register of Copyrights
---
From Kyle Courtney, Mary Minow, and me, posted at the Library Journal [here](http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2017/01/copyright/library-experts-weigh-in-on-next-register-of-copyrights/#_). Also, I wrote up a little [tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/bc_butler/status/819573406077222913) this morning about the last Register's [new job](http://www.infodocket.com/2017/01/12/maria-pallante-named-new-president-and-ceo-of-the-association-of-american-publishers-aap_a/), the revolving door, and the risk of cultural capture.
