> “Make no mistake: The prices of scientific journals now are so high that not a single university in the U.S. — not the University of California, not Harvard, no institution — can afford to subscribe to them all,” said Jeffrey MacKie-Mason, university librarian and economics professor at UC Berkeley, and co-chair of UC’s negotiation team. “Publishing our scholarship behind a paywall deprives people of the access to and benefits of publicly funded research. That is terrible for society.” 

Read the full [UC press release.](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-terminates-subscriptions-worlds-largest-scientific-publisher-push-open-access-publicly) I've always shared [Roger Schonfeld's doubts](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2018/09/04/read-publish-good-academy/) about the advisability of "read and publish" agreements, but I am fully on board for the general propositions UC is defending now that they've abandoned negotiating: Elsevier's business model is parasitic and broken, open access is the future, and locking our research behind paywalls is self-defeating and indefensible.
