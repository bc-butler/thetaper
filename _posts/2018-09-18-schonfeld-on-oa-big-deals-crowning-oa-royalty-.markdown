title: A Cautionary Note on Read and Publish
---

> Without authorsâ€™ price sensitivity as part of the model and by instead crowning the OA Royalty, there is every reason to believe that the Read and Publish Big Deal will be just as problematic for academia as has been the traditional Big Deal. 

- Roger Schonfeld in [Read and Publish: Is It Good for the Academy? at The Scholarly Kitchen](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2018/09/04/read-publish-good-academy/). 

I agree with Roger about these agreements that look to "flip" commercial publishers into Gold OA models. The problem with Big Deals isn't just the paywalls, it's that for-profit entities control access to venues that provide a necessary credential to scholars. As long as they have monopoly control over these venues, they will retain the power to extract monopoly rents from whomever they are charging, whether it's readers, authors, or (worst of all worlds) campuses on behalf of their authors. Turning Big Deals into OA Big Deals is jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire.
