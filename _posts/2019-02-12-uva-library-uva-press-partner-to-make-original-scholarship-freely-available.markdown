From UVA Today comes this [great profile](https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-library-uva-press-partner-make-original-scholarship-freely-available) of the Library's open publishing imprint [Aperio](http://aperio.press) and my colleague Dave Ghamandi, who is leading Aperio in collaboration with Mark Saunders at the University of Virginia Press. This praise from one of the Editors of our first open journal, the JMPhil, is everything we hoped for in launching this effort—connecting scholars with the tools and expertise they need to make open journals that work:
  
> "We didn’t really know how to manage hosting or article production or archiving or any number of other technical things that go along with running a journal. This is where UVA Library and Aperio came in,” said LoLordo. She added, “it’s been a fantastic experience” working with Aperio and Ghamandi.
