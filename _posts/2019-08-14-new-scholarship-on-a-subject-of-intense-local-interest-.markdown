If you're reading this blog, you may have at least a passing familiarity with the Jeffersonian aphorism from which The Taper [takes its name](http://thetaper.library.virginia.edu/2016/11/02/welcome-to-the-taper.html). If so, you might be interested in a [new article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3332477) by Jeremy Sheff, summarized and reviewed by Dave Fagundes [here](https://ip.jotwell.com/a-classical-perspective-on-information-ownership/), that traces the origins of the metaphor back to Cicero, and a very different theory of property and justice. Sheff explains that the Cicero's version of the taper story is a parable about charity and beneficence, built on a theory of property and justice that is, well, not very Jeffersonian. Looking forward to the reading the full article!
