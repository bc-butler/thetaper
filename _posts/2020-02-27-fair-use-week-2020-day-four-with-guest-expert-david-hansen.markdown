For Day Four of Fair Use Week, I want to commend to your attention an excellent blog post by my friend Dave Hansen, Associate University Librarian for Research, Collections & Scholarly Communications at Duke University Libraries. In it, he warns against over-reliance and oversimplification of fair use, and points to some recent cases where folks are in danger of hurting the doctrine by treating it like a "God in the Machine" that can swoop down and rescue us whenever we feel threatened by copyright law. Check it out here, at Harvard's OSC blog:
