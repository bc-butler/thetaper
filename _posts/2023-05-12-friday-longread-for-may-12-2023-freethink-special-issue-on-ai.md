title: 'Friday Longread for May 12, 2023: FreeThink Special Issue on AI'
publishd: true

Not long ago, the good folks at [_Freethink_](https://www.freethink.com/) asked me to expand and extend my thinking in my [Fair Use Week blog post on AI](http://thetaper.library.virginia.edu/2023/02/22/fair-use-week-2023-avoiding-copyright-literalism-and-the-fairness-of-computer-generated-works.html) to publish as part of a [special issue on AI and Creativity](https://www.freethink.com/special-issues/creativity-a-i). That issue just came out last week, and I think the whole thing will reward your time and attention. There is no hotter issue than AI and creatvity, at least in my corner of the universe, and I think they've done a great job of bringing together thinkers and ideas that go beyond the usual technophobia and dystopia thinking around this stuff.
