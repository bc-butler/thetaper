Happy Friday! Last week the Supreme Court dropped three opinions that libraries have been waiting for with fear and trepidation: *Warhol*, *Gonzalez*, and *Twitter.* In a brief interview with my UVA Library colleague Molly Minturn, I shared the upshot of these opinions for libraries and the students, scholars, and community members we serve.

*Photo of Andy Warhol's silkscreen portrait of Prince, "Orange Prince" (1984), posted here under fair use.*

And as a chaser, I co-wrote a piece about the implications of the _Warhol_ opinion for filmmakers with my friends Peter Jaszi and Pat Aufderheide, published online by _Filmmaker_ magazine here: [Warhol v. Goldsmith: a Narrow Decision Preserves Fair Use As We Know It for Filmmakers](https://filmmakermagazine.com/121412-warhol-v-goldsmith-a-narrow-decision-preserves-fair-use-as-we-know-it-for-filmmakers/).
