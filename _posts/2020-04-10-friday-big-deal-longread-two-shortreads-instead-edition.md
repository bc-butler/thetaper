title: 'Friday Big Deal Longread: ''Two Shortreads, Instead'' Edition'
---
Happy Friday, y'all! In lieu of the usual academic article or long-ish blogpost, I want to share two major Big Deal breakups that were announced in the last couple of days. Both [UNC-Chapel Hill](https://library.unc.edu/2020/04/upcoming-elsevier-cancellations/) and the entire [SUNY system](http://slcny.libguides.com/slc/elsevier2020update) have announced that they are breaking up their Big Deals with Elsevier, switching to an a la carte set of their most-used journal titles. The cuts appear to be quite deep - UNC is retaining 395 of the 2000 or so titles in the Big Deal, and SUNY has retained a 'core list' of 248 titles, which individual institutions in the system may augment with additional titles if needed to support local priorities.

Neither institution discloses what their total spend will be under the new deal, but UNC did say that to renew the Big Deal would have cost $2.6 million. SUNY says it **expects to save between $5 million and $7 million** as a result of the change, and that this will represent a **50-70% reduction in their spend on Elsevier.**

As we [explained](https://news.library.virginia.edu/2019/03/07/six-things-uva-researchers-need-to-know-about-the-uc-system-walking-away-from-elsevier/) when the University of California system made big news by leaving its Elsevier deal last year, the Big Deal has become a bad deal for most libraries: the [price is too high](http://thetaper.library.virginia.edu/2019/09/13/friday-big-deal-long-read-for-sept-13-2019-evaluating-big-deal-journal-bundles-by-bergstrom-courant-et-al.html) in absolute terms, it [grows too fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serials_crisis), the value of the bundle is [in decline](https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/16829/18997), and the values these publishers represent are [no longer aligned](http://thetaper.library.virginia.edu/big%20deal/longread/uc/elsevier/2019/09/30/belated-big-deal-long-read-for-friday-9-27-from-symbiont-to-parasite.html) with the [increasingly open ethos](http://thetaper.library.virginia.edu/2020/02/03/we-re-opening-everything-scientists-share-coronavirus-data-in-unprecedented-way-to-contain-treat-disease.html) of research. The deep cuts we see at UNC and SUNY may also be consistent with [my modest proposal](http://thetaper.library.virginia.edu/2018/10/26/the-2-5-commitment-a-modest-proposal-for-oa-week.html) that libraries divest from these deals in order to free up funds to invest in open alternatives, acting proactively to push the market toward models that work better for libraries and researchers.
