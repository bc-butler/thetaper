title: Toward a Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Software Preservation
---
I'm very excited to share that I'm working with my good friends at the Association of Research Libraries, including ARL's Krista Cox, and the creators of the fair use best practices method, Peter Jaszi and Pat Aufderheide at American University, on a new project: a [code of best practices in fair use for software preservation](http://www.arl.org/focus-areas/copyright-ip/fair-use/code-of-best-practices-in-fair-use-for-software-preservation "ARL's Code landing page"). With generous funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and in close collaboration with the [Software Preservation Network](http://www.softwarepreservationnetwork.org "SPN Homepage"), we are learning about the current state of the field, then we'll be helping the community to deliberate collectively about ways fair use can support its vital work.

You can read the UVA Library news item about this [here](http://news.library.virginia.edu/2017/10/23/code-of-best-practices-in-fair-use-for-software-preservation-coming-in-2018/ "UVA News item"). Watch this space (and the ARL landing page) for updates on the project!
