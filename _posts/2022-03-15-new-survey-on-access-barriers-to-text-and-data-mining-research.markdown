I'm working on something interesting with my friend and collaborator Pat Aufderheide: a survey of scholars who use text and data-mining to get a sense of whether and how copyright impacts their work. You can read more about the survey in Pat's blog post here: [New Survey on Access Barriers to Text and Data Mining Research](http://infojustice.org/archives/43919)

If you do this kind of research, please take the survey! Here are links to the surveyâ€”
