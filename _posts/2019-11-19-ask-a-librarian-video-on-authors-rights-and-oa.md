title: Ask a Librarian video on Authors' Rights and OA
categories:
  - authors' rights
  - open access

I recently had the opportunity to record this fun little interview about authors rights and open access with my colleague Ashley Hosbach, the Librarian who works with our Curry School of Education. Faculty at Curry, like so many at UVA, have a real impact on policy and practice every day, shaping the future of education in profound ways. Using open access, they can make their work even more accessible to policymakers, teachers, and learners, increasing their impact and changing the world for the better.
