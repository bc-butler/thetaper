This is a little bit meta, but Peter Suber recently shared a really nice resource that I wanted to turn around and share with you. It's a [Google Doc with a collection of links](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bVcx3SY7IjKX5_EM5pjNfJRghWa-dDaWjFpd1of5pQc/edit) that Peter compiled in connection with a talk he gave on UC, Elsevier, and Plan S. If the constellation of these three things interests you, you will definitely benefit from a perusal of these stories.
