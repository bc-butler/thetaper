title: 'UC President Janet Napolitano: "Knowledge to the People"'
---

UC system President Janet Napolitano has a nice post up today (a great coincidence with [our statement](https://news.library.virginia.edu/2019/04/09/statement-from-deans-and-directors-of-virginia-research-libraries-on-the-university-of-california-systems-termination-of-contract-with-elsevier/)) with a poignant rallying cry to public (and publicly funded) institutions: 

> Expanding educational access and increasing public knowledge and understanding of our world is a fundamental tenet of our institution. And achieving this is only possible when we ensure that UC is a conduit of information rather than being, or partnering with, its gatekeepers.
