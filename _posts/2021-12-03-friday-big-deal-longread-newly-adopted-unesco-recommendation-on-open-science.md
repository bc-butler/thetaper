title: 'Friday Big Deal Longread: Newly Adopted UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science'
---
The open science movement achieved a major victory last week when UNESCO member states unanimously approved a [Recommendation on Open Science](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949.locale=en). It's key objectives and areas of action are:

- Promoting a common understanding of open science, associated benefits and challenges, as well as diverse paths to open science;
- Developing and enabling a policy environment for open science;
- Investing in open science infrastructures and services;
- Investing in human resources, training, education, digital literacy and capacity building for open science;
- Fostering a culture of open science and aligning incentives for open science;
- Promoting innovative approaches for open science at different stages of the scientific process;
- Promoting international and multi-stakeholder cooperation in the context of open science and with view to reducing digital, technological and knowledge gaps.

As SPARC explains in its [statement](https://sparcopen.org/news/2021/sparc-statement-on-unesco-ratification-of-open-science-recommendation/) welcoming the Recommendations, 

> "Immediate and sustained collective action in these areas by all stakeholders—governments, funders, scientists, academic institutions, libraries, NGOs and the public—is the necessary next step."
