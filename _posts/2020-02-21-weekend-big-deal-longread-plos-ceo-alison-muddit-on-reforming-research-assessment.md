  Weekend Big Deal Longread: PLOS CEO Alison Muddit on Reforming Research
  Assessment
---
This week's longread is not too long, actually, but it's a nice exploration of a vexing topic, through the lens of a new tool that might help shift the dynamic in a very useful direction. Check out [Reforming Research Assessment: A Tough Nut to Crack](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2020/02/18/reforming-research-assessment-a-tough-nut-to-crack/), published earlier this week. And follow the links in her piece to read more about the [miserable culture](https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/what-researchers-think-about-research-culture) that permeates research, as well as the [deep thoughts at Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/blog/strategy-culture-change/) that animate the release of tools like the TOP Factor.

Have a great weekend!
