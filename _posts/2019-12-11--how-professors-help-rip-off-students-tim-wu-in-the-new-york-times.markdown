Strong but ultimately even-handed advice from Tim Wu in the New York Times today:

> A good instructor wants to use the best materials, and some of the expensive textbooks are excellent and arguably worth the price. But some really arenâ€™t, especially when there are cheaper or free alternatives of equal quality out there. Basic ethics suggest we have a duty to look for cheaper options before we inflict the $200 or $300 books or the $100 access codes on our students. Professors who write successful textbooks need to think harder about the professional ethics of allowing a book to be sold at exploitative prices to young people. 

The [full piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/opinion/textbook-prices-college.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share) is worth a read.

Here at UVA we are doing several things to help folks who want to lower costs for their students. In accordance with Virginia state law, we have a page with [Guidance for the Adoption of Open Educational Resources](https://provost.virginia.edu/quick-guide/teaching/guidance-for-adopttion-open-educational-resources). Thanks to another state law, we've also begun clearly labeling courses that use low- or no-cost resources, so that students who care about this issue know what to expect when they choose their courses. 

But in addition to these compliance efforts, we at the Library are offering affirmative assistance to faculty interested in lowering the cost of their courses in future iterations. Through a variety of [grants](https://vivalib.org/c.php?g=836990&p=6425615) and other opportunities, we hope to make it as easy as possible for folks who want to explore the alternatives that Wu describes.
