To celebrate [Fair Use Week 2021](https://www.fairuseweek.org), I was honored to contribute a [blog post on the Apple v. Corellium opinion](http://blogs.harvard.edu/copyrightosc/2021/02/23/fair-use-week-2021-day-two-with-guest-expert-brandon-butler/) to the *Copyright at Harvard Library* blog. The case has very interesting implications for software preservation. Most importantly, it finds that making a software title available for security research purposes is transformative, which is a crucial finding that strongly favors fair use. Libraries and other cultural heritage institutions should be encouraged by Judge Smith's ruling that fair use allows Corellium to build a lucrative business selling a platform that makes iOS available for research purposes. At the same time, there's a very troubling shoe yet to drop: the DMCA's "anti-trafficking" provision may swoop in to ruin everything, regardless of fair use.
