title: 'Ready or not, here it comes: the Copyright Claims Board is open for business'
---
Today is the first day that the new [Copyright Claims Board (CCB)](https://www.ccb.gov) is accepting, well, claims from the public. The CCB has been a big deal in copyright nerd circles for months, ever since Congress snuck through, er, passed the law (the CASE Act - 'Copyright Alternatives in Small claims Enforcement') which instructed the Copyright Office to create this new entity. We fretted about the [unconstitutionality](https://btlj.org/data/articles2018/vol33/33_3/Samuelson_Web.pdf) and the [inequitable consequences](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/case-act-hidden-coronavirus-relief-bill-just-beginning-next-copyright-battle) of creating a quasi-court in the executive branch to hear "small" claims (up to $30,000) that can account for a substantial portion of most folks' annual income. But ultimately, those concerns were not enough to stop the bill from being tacked onto a must-pass COVID relief bill and becoming law. So what does this new court-adjacent board thingy mean for faculty, students, and staff at a place like UVA? 

I'm glad you asked. Happily, I've posted a [handy explainer](https://copyright.library.virginia.edu/user-rights-and-responsibilities/copyright-small-claims/) over on the Copyright Resources page I maintain. By far and away the most important thing to know is that you **must not ignore an authentic CCB notice**, or else you risk defaulting and being liable for up to $30,000, regardless of the merit of the claim. Check out my Small Claims page for more info.

So far, my page is focused on what to do if you receive a notice that someone has filed a claim against you, since that is the most likely (though hopefully overall unlikely) way that someone in our community will encounter the CCB. If you think you have a copyright claim that could be fruitfully pursued through the CCB (you think someone is infringing your copyright, for example), you can learn more about how to do that from its [FAQ](https://www.ccb.gov/faq/).
