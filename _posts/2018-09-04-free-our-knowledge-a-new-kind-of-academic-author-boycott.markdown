> We plan to grow a community of academics who pledge to exclusively support community-owned free open access publication systems. Crucially, pledges made by members will only become active when a pre-specified threshold of support has been reached, with names anonymised until this time, allowing individuals to show support without risking their livelihoods.

Full campaign goes live in 2019, but worth perusing now. Sad that folks feel like this is the kind of pledge they have to sign—I'll stop participating in this awful system if enough other people all agree to do the same—but it also makes perfect sense given the realities of the prestige economy in academia.
