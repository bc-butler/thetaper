I had the pleasure of talking to Andrew Albanese at *Pubishers Weekly* about AI, copyright, and the creative economy for this piece: [Authors Join the Brewing Legal Battle Over AI](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/copyright/article/92783-authors-join-the-brewing-legal-battle-over-ai.html). Andrew is one of the most perceptive observers of this little corner of the world - the intersection of law, technology, book culture, and the book industry, and it was great to chat with him and share what I think is maybe the hardest thing for some folks to grasp: the parts of the creative economy that could be decimated very quickly by AI cannot be saved by copyright. I didn't say this to Andrew because I don't think it had occurred to me, yet, but watching the SAG-AFTRA and Writers Guild go on strike to get a deal that charts a sustainable coexistence for writers, actors, and robots sure seems like a better approach. If only more creative sectors were as unionized as Hollywood.
