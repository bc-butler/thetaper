I was lucky enough to be able to advise Prof. Guler just a little bit as she was working with Arin to develop this grant proposal, which supports the creation of new virtual reality models of infectious diseases. I was thrilled by her interest in making all the products of this grant openly and freely available for reuse as open educational resources. Once their completed, all models will be posted to the [VIVA Open](https://vivaopen.oercommons.org/) OER hub to ensure these very cool tools are findable and reusable by teachers and students anywhere in the world.
