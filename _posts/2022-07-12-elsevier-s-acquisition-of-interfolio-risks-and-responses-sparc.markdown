Anyone who shares this blog's concern about the steady drumbeat of consolidation in the research publishing and infrastructure business should run, not walk, to read SPARC's recent analysis of [Elsevier's Acquisition of Interfolio: Risks and Responses](https://infrastructure.sparcopen.org/interfolio-acquisition). It's been out for a couple of weeks, but I've been on vacation, so I'm just now getting around to it. If you're on a similar summer schedule, this report may have passed you by. Since outdated faculty evaluation standards and resulting broken incentives are a root cause of the inertia in our broken scholarly communication system, the acquisition of a key faculty evaluation tool by the leading oligopolist in the system is a Big Red Flag. It's great that SPARC has its eye on this, and we will look to them for leadership on this issue as it evolves.
