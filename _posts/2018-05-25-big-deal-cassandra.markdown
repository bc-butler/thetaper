> Academic library directors should not sign on to the Big Deal or any comprehensive licensing agreements with commercial publishers.

> You read that right. Don't buy the Big Deal.â€¦ [T]he Big Deal serves only the Big Publishers. Many other university and college libraries are also investigating their options, recognizing -- as we all do -- that the push to build an all-electronic collection can't be undertaken at the risk of: (1) weakening that collection with journals we neither need nor want, and (2) increasing our dependence on publishers who have already shown their determination to monopolize the information marketplace.
