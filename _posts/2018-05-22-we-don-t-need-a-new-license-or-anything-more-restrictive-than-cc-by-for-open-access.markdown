> CC-BY does indeed allow resale â€” of something that is already on the Internet for free. Anyone who pays for an object under CC-BY is either making a donation, or is paying a tax for being inept at searching the Internet. And a few key elements of CC-BY make it possible to prevent dastardly uses. 

From [A fool's errand](https://www.nature.com/articles/495440a), by John Wilbanks. Read the whole thing. Apparently the IASTM (a trade org for STEM publishers) is proposing a *new* "open" license for OA publishing. This is a Bad Idea.
