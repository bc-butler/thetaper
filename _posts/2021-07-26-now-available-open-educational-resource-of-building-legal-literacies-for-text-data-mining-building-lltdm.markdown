I'm excited to share this news about a [new OER on legal literacies for text and data mining](https://berkeley.pressbooks.pub/buildinglltdm/).  I worked on the “Building LLTDM” project last summer - it was an NEH-sponsored summer institute that brought together legal experts, library professionals, and scholars to work through a set of core literacies for working with text and data mining methodologies using copyright- and otherwise encumbered content. I've shared the draft materials internally with colleagues here at UVA because I couldn't wait to get it into other people's hands, but now there’s a final, published/polished OER hosted by Pressbooks. Please share far and wide - we hope it will be useful for folks!
