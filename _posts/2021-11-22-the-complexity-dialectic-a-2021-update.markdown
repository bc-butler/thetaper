Jonathan Band has just published an interesting quantitative update on his excellent 2015 essay [The Complexity Dialectic: A Case Study From Copyright Law](https://infojustice.org/archives/34061). In his original essay, Jonathan argued that forces at play in the US regulatory system lead to unworkably complex rules that ill-serve the public. He used the US Copyright Office's triennial Rulemaking for the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (whew!) as his prime example, and this year he has an update showing how the number of words used in the rules has changed over time. Check out the full piece, and the statistics, here:
