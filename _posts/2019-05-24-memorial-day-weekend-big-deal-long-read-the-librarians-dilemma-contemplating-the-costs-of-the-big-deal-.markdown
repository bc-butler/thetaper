As I said a year ago, when I first ran across this essay, Ken Frazier was a [Big Deal Cassandra](http://thetaper.library.virginia.edu/2018/05/25/big-deal-cassandra.html) back in 2001â€”he tried to warn us at the dawn of the Big Deals that nothing good would come of them, but nobody listened. In [The Librarians' Dilemma: Contemplating the Costs of the "Big Deal"](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march01/frazier/03frazier.html), Frazier made a compelling case against these new package deals of electronic journals. 18 years and countless budget crises later, Frazier is looking downright prophetic.
