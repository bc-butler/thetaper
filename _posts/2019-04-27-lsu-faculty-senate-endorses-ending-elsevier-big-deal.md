title: LSU Faculty Senate Endorses Ending Elsevier Big Deal
---
Louisiana State University Dean of Libraries Stanley Wilder [announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sjwilder100/status/1121156752769155072) last Wednesday that the LSU faculty senate had overwhelmingly passed a resolution in favor of leaving the Elsevier Big Deal. They follow [Florida State University](https://news.library.virginia.edu/2018/04/26/no-big-deal-fsu-cancels-elsevier-bundle-citing-outdated-model-and-out-of-control-cost/) and the [University of California system](https://www.chronicle.com/article/A-Lesson-From-UC-s-Split/245811) in securing a broad faculty endorsement of their Big Deal position in advance of negotiations with the big publisher. You can read a little more about the LSU resolution in the [announcement](http://news.blogs.lib.lsu.edu/2019/04/05/lsu-libraries-faculty-senate-consider-responses-to-rising-journal-costs/) they posted earlier this month. Gary Price has collected the minutes of the meeting and the text of the resolution at his [Infodocket post](https://www.infodocket.com/2019/04/05/louisiana-state-university-lsu-faculty-senate-plans-vote-on-resolution-that-recommends-cancellation-of-elsevier-journal-package-and-move-to-a-la-carte-purchase-model/?utm_source=id&utm_medium=IDTW&utm_campaign=articles).
