title: LSU Faculty Senate Endorses Ending Elsevier Big Deal
---
Louisiana State University Dean of Libraries Stanley Wilder [announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sjwilder100/status/1121156752769155072) last Wednesday that the LSU faculty senate had overwhelmingly passed a resolution in favor of leaving the Elsevier Big Deal. They follow Florida State University and the University of California system in securing a broad faculty endorsement of their Big Deal position in advance of negotiations with the big publisher. You can read a little more about the LSU resolution in the [announcement](http://news.blogs.lib.lsu.edu/2019/04/05/lsu-libraries-faculty-senate-consider-responses-to-rising-journal-costs/) they posted earlier this month.
