I was proud to be part of the drafting process, and to sign onto this: [Joint Comment to WIPO on Copyright and Artificial Intelligence](http://infojustice.org/archives/42009). As WIPO appears to be embarking on a policy inquiry into the relationship between AI (so hot right now) and copyright, this early intervention tries to ensure they ask the right questions.
